# List of TB and Pneumonia X-ray Datasets
A list of publicly available Tuberculosis (TB) and Pneumonia chest x-ray image sources.

When I first worked on a TB project a few years ago there were only 394 publicly available TB chest x-ray images. These were part of the well know Montgomery and Shenzhen datasets. Since then the number of available images has grown, but they are not easy to find. Therefore, I've tried to list all the data sources here to make things easier for those working on ML projects. I've also included Pneumonia because my rough research has shown that these two conditions look similar on chest x-rays e.g. they appear as opacity. 

In some cases the entire dataset is dedicated to one disease, in other cases the TB or Pneumonia images are located inside other much larger datasets.
